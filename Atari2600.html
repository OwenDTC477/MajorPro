<h4>Atari 2600</h4> 
  <ul>
    <p style="color:White">The Atari 2600, originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS) until November 1982, is a home video game console developed and 
      produced by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it popularized the use of microprocessor-based hardware and of games stored on swappable 
      ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of
      paddle controllers, and a game cartridge—initially Combat and later Pac-Man. </p>
    
<p style="color:White">Atari was successful at creating arcade games, but their cost to develop and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home 
  system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technologies in late 1975 made this feasible. Development of the console—known as "Stella" during
  its prototype stage—was performed by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Atari was recovering from heavily losses in the 1974 fiscal year, and lacking 
  funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976. Warner's investment helped to hurry completion of the console
  following the release of the Channel F</p>
