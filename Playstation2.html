<h4>Playstation 2</h4> 
  <ul>
 <p style="color:White"> The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on
      March 4, 2000, in North America on October 26, 2000, in Europe on November 24, 2000, and in Australia on November 30, 2000. It is the successor
      to the original PlayStation, as well as the second installment in the PlayStation console line-up. A sixth-generation console, it competed with 
      Sega's Dreamcast, Nintendo's GameCube, and Microsoft's original Xbox. </p>
    
    <p style="color:White">Announced in 1999, the PS2 offered backward-compatibility for its predecessor's DualShock controller, as well as its games. The PS2 is the 
      best-selling video game console of all time, having sold over 155 million units worldwide. Over 3,800 game titles have been released for the 
      PS2, with over 1.5 billion copies sold. Sony later manufactured several smaller, lighter revisions of the console known as Slimline models in 
      2004.</p>
    
    <p style="color:White">Even with the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3, the PS2 remained popular well into the seventh generation, 
      and continued to be produced until 2013, when Sony finally announced it had been discontinued after over twelve years of productionâ€”one of the 
      longest lifespans of a video game console. Despite the announcement, new games for the console continued to be produced until the end of 2013,
      including Final Fantasy XI: Seekers of Adoulin for Japan, FIFA 14 for North America, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 for Europe. Repair 
      services for the system in Japan ended on September 7, 2018. </p>
