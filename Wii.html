<h4>Wii</h4> 
  <ul>
    <p style="color:White">The Wii is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It was first released on November 19, 2006 in North America and in 
      December 2006 for most other regions. It is Nintendo's fifth major home game console, following the GameCube, and is a seventh generation home 
      console alongside Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. </p>
    
   <p style="color:White"> In developing the Wii, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata directed the company to avoid competing with Microsoft and Sony on computational 
      graphics and power and instead to target a broader demographic of players though novel gameplay. Game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo 
      Takeda led the console's development under the codename Revolution. The primary controller for the Wii is the Wii Remote, a wireless controller
      with both motion sensing and traditional controls which can be used as a pointing device towards the television screen or for gesture recognition.
      The Wii was the first Nintendo console to directly support Internet connectivity, supporting both online games and for digital distribution of
      games and media applications through the Wii Shop Channel. The Wii also supports wireless connectivity with the Nintendo DS handheld console for 
      selected games. Initial Wii models included full backward compatibility support for the GameCube. Later in its lifecycle, two lower-cost Wii models
      were produced: a revised model with the same design as the original Wii but removed the GameCube compatibility features, and the Wii Mini, a 
      compact, budget redesign of the Wii which further removed features including online connectivity and SD card storage.</p>
    
    <p style="color:White">Because of Nintendo's reduced focus on computational power, the Wii and its games were less expensive to produce than its competitors. 
      The Wii was extremely popular at launch, causing the system to be in short supply in some markets. A bundled game, Wii Sports, was considered
      the killer app for the console. Within a year of launch, the Wii became the sales-leader against the other seventh-generation consoles, and by
      2013, had surpassed over 100 million units sold. Total lifetime sales of the Wii had reached over 101 million units, making it Nintendo's
      best-selling home console, and as of 2020, the fourth best-selling home console to date. </p>
    
    <p style="color:White"> The Wii repositioned Nintendo as a key player in the video game hardware marketplace. The introduction of motion-controlled games via the Wii 
      Remote led both Microsoft and Sony to develop their own competing productsâ€”the Kinect and PlayStation Move, respectively. Nintendo found that,
      while the Wii had broadened the demographics that they wanted, the core gamer audience had shunned the Wii. The Wii's successor, the Wii U, sought 
      to recapture the core gamer market with additional features atop the Wii. The Wii U was released in 2012, and Nintendo continued to sell both
      units through the following year. The Wii was formally discontinued in October 2013, though Nintendo continued to produce and market the Wii 
      Mini through 2017, and offered a subset of the Wii's online services through 2019.</p>
