<h4>SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System)</h4> 
  <ul>
   <p style="color:White"> style="color:white"> The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES),commonly shortened to Super NES or Super Nintendo, is a 16-bit home video game console 
      developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea, 1991 in North America, 1992 in Europe and Oceania, and 1993 in South
      America. In Japan, the system is called the Super Famicom (SFC). In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by 
      Hyundai Electronics. The system was released in Brazil on August 30, 1993, by Playtronic. Although each version is essentially the same,
      several forms of regional lockout prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another. </p>
    
    <p style="color:White">The SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The console introduced 
      advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development 
      of a variety of enhancement chips integrated into game cartridges to be competitive into the next generation.</p>
    
    <p style="color:White">The SNES received largely positive reviews and was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era after launching relatively 
      late and facing intense competition from Sega's Genesis console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES 
      remained popular well into the 32-bit era, with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular
      among collectors and retro gamers, with new homebrew games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the Virtual Console, the Super NES Classic 
      Edition, and Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
