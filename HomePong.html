<h4>Home Pong</h4> 
  <ul>
    <p style="color:White"> During the winter of 1975, Atari released one of the first consoles that played only Pong. Being that first publicly home console released there were some
      flaws such as only having Pong in it and the massive power adapter to it. eventually over time they had created an upraged system that played more of Atrai's games
      but it didn't become as popular due to it expensive price tag. </p>
  </ul>
